# The underappreciated diversity of bile acid modifications
# Figure_1: Stage 1 MassQL query and distribution patterns of delta masses
Scripts developed for generating Figure_1d (python) and Figure_1e (R) are available in this folder along with the source data tables needed as input. This figure highlights the generation of Stage 1 MassQL query, caluculation of delta masses and the sunsequent visualization of their distribution based on the class of bile acids (non-, mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, pentahydroxy). 
# Figure_2: Distributions of delta masses obtained from fastMASST searches
Scripts for generating Figure 2a,2b,2c,2d (python) are available with the source data tables. The input tables are obtained after searching for similar spectra of MassQL MS/MS output using fastMASST. This figure demonstrates the distribution of unique delta masses across different body parts in rodents and humans. Using UpSet plots we also highlight delta masses that are present in multiple bile acid classes. 
# Figure_3: Evidence for microbial-derived bile acids
Input data for generating the taxomomic tree in Figure_3b using iToL is available in the Source_data subfolder, which includes 1)list of all NCBI IDs of microbes in microbeMASST repository 2) list of NCBI IDs of microbes with MS/MS matches to bile acids 3) newick file of taxonomy generated by phyloT. 
Scripts for generating Figure_3c,3d,3e (R) are available with the respective input data files. For Figure_3d, 3e the feature tables are generated by getting peak areas with manual integration in Skyline.
